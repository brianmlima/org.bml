=======

A collection of java utilities I have built and or modified over the last ten years to adress high concurrency and high availability systems as well as large scale data processing. NOTE: this project is currently functional however the repository is not yet setup for ease of use. This will change over the next few weeks as I get better at conforming to standards.

Currently there are a few dependancies I have had to add to my local maven repo. I will be compiling a list of these and instructions on how to get them, possubly including a bash script.
